# Sales Prediction Project

This project is focused on predicting car purchasing behavior using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical sales data and customer information to forecast car purchase amounts. The project applies various data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values, removing outliers, scaling features, and training machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost.

## Task Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, drop unnecessary columns, detect and remove outliers using IQR, and apply feature scaling.
- **Model Selection and Training**: Use Random Forest and XGBoost models for sales prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² Score to determine the best-performing model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune models using GridSearchCV to optimize performance.
